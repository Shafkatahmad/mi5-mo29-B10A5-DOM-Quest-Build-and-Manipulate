## ðŸ›  Planned Improvements / Learning Roadmap

I am continuously learning and improving this project. Some of the new things I plan to add include:

- Using **LocalStorage** to persist donation history and balance after page reloads.
- Adding **form validation** and better error handling for donation inputs.
- Implementing a **Dark Mode toggle** for better user customization.
- Refactoring to create **dynamic donation cards** using JavaScript.
- Loading donation causes with the **Fetch API** from a JSON file or external API.
- Deploying the project on **Netlify/Vercel** for live access.
- Improving **accessibility** with ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
